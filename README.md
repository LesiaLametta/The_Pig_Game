# The_Pig_Game
## My first simple JS Game
### GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his round score
- But if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- There is an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100
